# Matching: There and Back Again

This repository contains a PDF file, corresponding to a working paper on the synergies between genetic matching and entropy balancing, and a consolidated, working version of replication files corresponding to the data analysis presented in the paper.

*Matching: There and Back Again* alludes to the fact that reweighting methods, such as Entropy Balancing, present a conundrum to the causal analysis of treatment effect in observational studies. In the past, matching methods aimed to achieve covariate overlap and secure that causal inference was done by comparing "apples to apples." Reweighting methods offer the prospects of easily achieved full covariate overlap. The question remains, however, whether *any* full overlap secures sound causal inference. I aim to disagree with Hainmueller (2012) and argue that as it stands, the application of entropy balancing creates an overreliance on too few controls and, thus, remains inferior to more statistically sound matching methods.

The current abstract of this paper follows.
Covariate balance, assuming a robust design, is the holy grail of causal inference in observational studies. Nothing can save poor designs, but often even strong ones need to be supplemented by adequate statistical methods. I investigate the synergies between matching and reweighting methods exemplified by genetic matching and entropy balancing. Now that full overlap can be practically achieved, several theoretical questions gaps must be filled before researchers can fully trust their balanced estimates.
